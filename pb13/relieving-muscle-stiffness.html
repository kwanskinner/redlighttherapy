By targeting sebum production and reducing inflammation, it helps combat acne vulgaris, including blackheads and pimples, while also promoting collagen production to reduce fine lines such as crow's feet. <br><br>  At its core, red light therapy works by utilizing photobiomodulation, a process that delivers light to the mitochondria, the energy powerhouses of cells.
